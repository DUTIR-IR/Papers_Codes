# Neural Attentive Recommendation Machine

This is our implementation for the paper:

Jing Li, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen, Zhaochun Ren, Tao Lian and Jun Ma (2017). Neural Attentive Session-based Recommendation. In Proceedings of CIKM'17, Singapore, Singapore, Nov 06-10, 2017.

We have additionally released our Theano implementation of Neural Attentive Recommendation Machine under our proposed neural network framework.

**Please cite our CIKM'17 paper if you use our codes. Thanks!**
