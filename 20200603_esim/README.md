## Requirement
1. gensim
```bash
pip install gensim
```

2. Tensorflow 1.9-1.12 + Python2.7

## Steps
1. Download the [Ubuntu dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2fdn26rj6h9bpvl/ubuntu_data.zip?dl=0
) released by (Xu et al, 2017)

2. Unzip the dataset and put data directory into `data/`

3. Preprocess dataset, including concatenatate context and build vocabulary
```bash
cd data
python prepare.py
```

4. Train word2vec
```bash
bash run_train_word2vec.sh
```

5. Train and test ESIM, the log information is in `log.txt` file. You could find an example log file in `log_example.txt`.
```bash
cd scripts/esim
bash run.sh
```
